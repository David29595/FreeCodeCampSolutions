# FreeCodeCampSolutions

My solutions for some of the problems from [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). Contains solutions to the a lot of the javascript algorithm challenges and my initial versions of the Front End Certification projects. Still a work in progress as I continue to go through the curriculum.

ToDo: Finish Intermediate and Advanced problems and add tests for each challenge
